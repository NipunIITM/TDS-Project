# Data Analyst Agent (Gemini)

A powerful AI-powered data analysis API that uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash to source, prepare, analyze, and visualize any data. This agent can handle complex data analysis tasks including web scraping, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Features

- **Intelligent Data Analysis**: Uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash for fast and accurate data analysis
- **Web Scraping**: Can automatically scrape data from URLs (Wikipedia, APIs, etc.)
- **File Processing**: Supports CSV files and other data formats
- **Data Visualization**: Creates charts and plots encoded as base64 data URIs
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs correlations, regressions, and other statistical operations
- **Secure Execution**: Safely executes generated Python code in a controlled environment
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for deployment on platforms like Render
- **Large Context Window**: Benefits from Gemini's extensive context understanding

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd data-analyst-agent-gemini
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
PORT=8080
```

**Get your Gemini API key from**: [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### 4. Run Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## API Usage

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/
```

### Request Format

Send a multipart form request with:
- `questions.txt` (required): Contains your data analysis questions
- `data.csv` (optional): Your data file
- Additional files as needed

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/ \
  -F "questions.txt=@questions.txt" \
  -F "data.csv=@data.csv"
```

### Example Questions File

Create a `questions.txt` file:

```
Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array containing the answers:
1. How many $2 billion movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 billion?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak columns?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank vs Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.

Return the plot as a base-64 encoded data URI under 100,000 bytes.
```

### Example Response

```json
[
  1,
  "Titanic",
  0.485782,
  "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8/5+hHgAHggJ/PchI7wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
]
```

## Local Testing

### Test with Sample Data

1. Create a `questions.txt` file with your analysis questions
2. Optionally create a `data.csv` file with your data
3. Run the curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/ \
  -F "questions.txt=@questions.txt" \
  -F "data.csv=@data.csv"
```

### Test Web Scraping

Create a `questions.txt` file that asks for data from a URL:

```
Analyze the data from https://example.com/data.csv
1. How many rows are in the dataset?
2. What are the column names?
3. Show summary statistics for numeric columns.
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Render

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a new public repository on GitHub
   - Push your code to the repository

2. **Connect to Render**:
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New" â†’ "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure Service**:
   - **Name**: `data-analyst-agent-gemini`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Instance Type**: Free (or paid for better performance)

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key from Google AI Studio
   - Add `PORT` with value `10000` (Render's default)

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Your API will be available at `https://your-service-name.onrender.com/api/`

### Deploy to Other Platforms

The application is compatible with:
- **Heroku**: Use the included `requirements.txt` and set environment variables
- **Railway**: Direct deployment from GitHub
- **Google Cloud Run**: Use Docker or direct Python deployment
- **AWS Lambda**: With appropriate adaptations for serverless

## Architecture

The application uses an efficient architecture:

1. **LLM as Planner**: Gemini generates Python code to solve the analysis task
2. **Secure Execution**: Generated code runs in a controlled environment
3. **Result Capture**: Results are captured from the executed code
4. **Token Efficiency**: Minimizes API costs by using the LLM only for planning

## Gemini Advantages

- **Fast Response Times**: Gemini 1.5 Flash is optimized for speed
- **Large Context Window**: Can handle extensive data descriptions and complex queries
- **Cost Effective**: Competitive pricing for API usage
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Excellent at understanding complex analytical requirements

- No file system access beyond the execution scope
- Memory management with plot cleanup
- Input validation and error handling

## Supported Analysis Types

- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlations, regressions, descriptive statistics
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, histograms
- **Web Scraping**: Wikipedia, APIs, CSV files from URLs
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing value handling, data type conversions
- **Time Series**: Date parsing, trend analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Basic regression, classification

## Error Handling
